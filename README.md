NasaCraft: Modern Android Development
Explore Space with MVVM, Coroutines, and Hilt
This Android application demonstrates dependency injection with Hilt, asynchronous programming with Kotlin Coroutines, and the MVVM architecture to fetch and display stunning NASA images.

Features:

Fetch images from the NASA API (requires API key from https://api.nasa.gov/)
Persist images locally using Room database for offline access
Leverage Flow API for seamless data updates in the UI
Technologies:

Kotlin: Modern, concise, and type-safe language for Android development
Room: Local database for offline data persistence
Hilt: Dependency injection framework for simplified code management
MVVM: Architectural pattern separating concerns for cleaner code
WorkManager (optional): Asynchronous task scheduling library
Coroutines: Structured concurrency for asynchronous operations
Flow API: Reactive data streams for managing UI updates
